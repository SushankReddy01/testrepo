During working hours, the company only permits employees to use technology such as cellphones, social media or the internet for personal use while on break. When posting company-related content on social media, employees must express that they're posting on behalf of themselves and not the company. The opinions they express should be respectful of the company. If an employee has a comment or concern about the company, it's best they bring it up to their manager or human resources rather than posting it online.
